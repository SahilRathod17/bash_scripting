### Introduction 

<p> A Bash script is a plain text file which contains a series of commands. These commands are a mixture of commands we would normally type ourselves on the command line (for example cd or pwd) and commands we could type on the command line but generally wouldn't.</p>

üîπ First script

 <p> Open any text editor you are familiar (for example vi editor) with. It is convention to give files that are Bash Scripts an extension of .sh (here first.sh for example) </p>

 ```
 $ vi first.sh
 ```
 <br>
 
 ```
#!/bin/bash
# First script
echo "Hello World"
 ```
* Line 1 :
  - #! is called as the SHEBANG character, it tells the script to interpret the rest of the lines with an Interpreter /bin/bash. so, if we change to /usr/bin/python then it tells the script to use python interpreter.

* Line 2 :
    - This is comment. Anything after # is not executed ( same as # in python ). It is for our refrence. it is used so that we can define what this script exactly does.

* Line 3 :
    - echo command will print the message on the screen. we can use this command on command-line and it will behave exactly the same.

üîπ Executing Script

 ```
$ sh first.sh
 ```
<br>

```
$ chmod +x first.sh
$ ./first.sh
```
