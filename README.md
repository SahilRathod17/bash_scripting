### Introduction 

<p> A Bash script is a plain text file which contains a series of commands. These commands are a mixture of commands we would normally type ourselves on the command line (for example cd or pwd) and commands we could type on the command line but generally wouldn't.</p>

üîπ First script

 <p> Open any text editor you are familiar (for example vi editor) with. It is convention to give files that are Bash Scripts an extension of .sh (here first.sh for example) </p>

 ```
 $ vi first.sh
 ```
 <br>
 
 ```
#!/bin/bash
# First script
echo "Hello World"
 ```
* Line 1 :
  - #! is called as the SHEBANG character, it tells the script to interpret the rest of the lines with an Interpreter /bin/bash. so, if we change to /usr/bin/python then it tells the script to use python interpreter.

* Line 2 :
    - This is comment. Anything after # is not executed ( same as # in python ). It is for our refrence. it is used so that we can define what this script exactly does.

* Line 3 :
    - echo command will print the message on the screen. we can use this command on command-line and it will behave exactly the same.

üîπ Executing Script

 ```
$ sh first.sh
 ```
<br>

```
$ chmod +x first.sh
$ ./first.sh
```

### Variables

<p>A bash variable acts as temporary storage for a string or a number. Bash variables are prevalent when it comes to bash scripting. Variables also make it easy for users to write complex functions and perform various operations. Users can create variables by giving them a name and a value. A name can be anything.</p>

üîπ Working with variables

 <p>A variable is a temporary store for a piece of information. There are two actions we may perform for variables.</p>


 * Setting a value for a variable.
 * Reading or using the value for a variable.

 <pre>To assign a variable we use = sign, VariableName=Value</pre>
 <pre>To read/access the valu of variable we use $VariableName</pre>
